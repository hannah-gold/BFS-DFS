# Title: BFS-DFS-Traversal-Song!

# Description
Utilizes piano chords and drums to create an upbeat/catchy tune accompanied
with lyrics about BFS and DFS traversal to help listeners remember the 
difference between the two traversal methods. The piano intro hook is so
memorable so that when a CS student hears it, it will be catchy enough to get
stuck in their head. The song is very repetitive on purpose because it helps
with memorization but it is obvious when a chorus is coming up because of the
musical hook embedded in.
